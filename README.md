## What is this ?

This is a fork of the excellent [pianobar](https://github.com/PromyLOPh/pianobar) 
project that adds features of interest of premium Pandora subscribers.

If you only use a free account then there is little of interest here unless you
are into podcasts.

However if you have a premium account this fork adds support for playlists,
albums and tracks.  See the [Wiki](https://github.com/skiphansen/pianobar/wiki/Premium-Features) for more details.
